This project was implemented to practice the objectives for Lambda School's FSW Course, Unit 2 Web Applications, Sprint 5: Applied JavaScript.

* DOM Elements
* Events and Event Listeners
* Components
* Component Creation by Array Iteration
* Data from an API with Axios

This project applied JavaScript DOM element creation and manipulation. The data for the project was sourced using the Axios library for the HTTP GET request and promise syntax to handle the response. 

The file architecture was designed to practice the concept of modular components. The entire site was built through one html entry point. The header, main, and footer, and menu were built programmatically with JavaScript and styled with individual component CSS stylesheets.

The site is deployed with netlify.
